# Single-File-Web-Apps

This is a list of Single-File Web Apps (apps that are made of a single `.html` file with all dependencies embedded). If you know of any other SFWAs, please edit this list and submit an MR!


Single-File Web Apps:
* <https://fuzzygraph.com> - a graphing calculator that shows not only where an equation is true, but also close to true
* <https://hypervault.github.io> - a file encryption app that runs as a single HTML page, and outputs an HTML file containing both your encrypted data, and the code to decrypt it (if the correct password is provided)
